        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Tostada, a crispy fried tortilla, often spread with refried beans or guacamole and topped with vegetables and other
        ingredients. Popular in Mexico, the tortilla—usually a corn tortilla—is flat or bowl-shaped after frying and given a
        layer of beans or guacamole thick enough to hold the other toppings.</p>

        <h4>Ingredients</h4>

                <li>Vegetable Oil</li>

                <li>1/3 cup freshly squeezed lime juice</li>
                <li>1/4 cup olive oil</li>
                <li>1/4 cup chopped fresh coriander (cilantro)</li>
                <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
                <li>Refried Beans, warm, recipe follows</li>
                <li>3 ounces Monterey Jack cheese, shredded (about 1/2 cup)</li>
                <li>1/2 head iceberg lettuce, cored and shredded</li>
                <li>1 Hass avocado, thinly sliced or Guacamole, recipe follows</li>
                <li>2 cups Salsa Cruda, recipe follows</li>
                <li>1/2 cup sour cream</li>
                <li>1 scallion, thinly sliced</li>
                <li>12 fresh coriander (cilantro) leaves</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Steps:</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>To make the tortillas: Pour the oil for frying into a large heavy-bottomed pot to a depth of about 2 inches. Place over
                    medium heat and heat to 375 degrees F. Add the tortillas, one at a time, and fry until golden brown and crispy, about 1
                    1/2 minutes. Using tongs, transfer to a paper towel-lined pan and sprinkle with salt. Set aside.</li>
                    <li>To make the chicken: In a small bowl, mix together the chicken, lime juice, oil, coriander, and salt and season with
                    pepper to taste. Cover with plastic wrap and set aside.</li>
                    <li>To assemble the tostadas: Preheat the broiler. Spread the beans evenly over one side of each tortilla and sprinkle with
                    some of the cheese. Transfer to a baking sheet and broil until the cheese is lightly browned and melted, about 30
                    seconds. Divide the tortillas among 6 plates.</li>
                    <li>Evenly mound the chicken on each tortilla and top with the lettuce. Top each tostada with avocado, salsa, and a dollop
                    of sour cream. Sprinkle with the scallion and garnish the tostada with the coriander leaves. Serve immediately.</li>
                    <li>Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the onion, coriander, and cumin and cook, stirring, until
                    lightly browned, about 2 minutes. Add the garlic and cook, until lightly browned, about 1 minute more. Add the beans and
                    cook, stirring frequently, until thick and amber brown in color, about 4 minutes. Stir in the salt and season with
                    pepper to taste.</li>
                    <li>In a small bowl, mix together the tomatoes, onion, jalapeno, coriander, salt, and season with pepper to taste. Cover
                    with plastic wrap and set aside.</li>
                </ol>
